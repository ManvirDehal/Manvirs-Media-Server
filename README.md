# Manvir's Media Server
### A brief tutorial for setting up Manvir's Media Server

Step 1. Install Jellyfin on your supported device. See below for steps to install on popular devices.


## IOS
  1. Search for Jellyfin in the app store
  2. Install either Swiftfin or Jellyfin Mobile. I recommend Jellyfin Mobile as Swiftfin is still in beta.
  3. When first opening Jellyfin Mobile you will be prompted with a Server Address bar. Type in 99.234.148.203:9090 and click go.
  4. You are now connected to the server and will need to enter your login information.
  5. Enjoy.
