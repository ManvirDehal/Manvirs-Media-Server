# Manvir's Media Server
### A brief tutorial for setting up Manvir's Media Server

Step 1. Install Jellyfin on your supported device. See below for steps to install on popular devices.

## Windows
1. Click the following link https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases
2. Head down to the assets tab of the latest release and click on the x64.exe, or x86.exe if you're on a 32 bit system
3. Go through all the steps to install it and click on add server.
4. You will then be prompted with a server address bar in which you will need to enter the provided server address bar, given to you upon payment
5. 
## iOS and Android
 1. Search for Jellyfin in the app store or playstore and install the latest version. The iOS version of Jellyfin has two apps, Swiftfin and Jellyfin Mobile. I recommend Jellyfin Mobile as Swiftfin is still in beta, but feel free to try it out. 
 2. When first opening Jellyfin Mobile you will be prompted with a server address bar in which you need to enter the provided server address, given to you upon payment
 3. You are now connected to the server and will need to enter your login information
 4. Enjoy.
